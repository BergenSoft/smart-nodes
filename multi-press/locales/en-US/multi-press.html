    <p>This node counts how often a certain key has been pressed. A further key press must be made within the set time.</p>
    <p>If no further key press is made after the set time, a message with the set content is sent to the corresponding output.</p>
    <p>If the maximum number of key presses is reached, a message is sent out immediately. Further key presses are counted and evaluated from the beginning again.</p>
