        The central node forwards incoming messages to all linked sub-modules.
        The module ensures that the functions of the submodules are kept synchronized.

    <p>
        This means that if a <code>toggle</code> is sent to several light modules, these will be switched off first if at least one was switched on.<br />
        Roller shutters will also be stopped if at least one is currently active. A <code>toggle</code> to several roller shutters is not currently supported.
