    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> This node was developed if the KNX roller shutter control cannot be used and you are forced to use 2 separate outputs for up and down.
        It is highly recommended that the outputs lock each other to prevent simultaneous control. Everyone is responsible for any damage to the roller shutter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Smart nodes use topics in the format <code>name#number</code>, so that different smart nodes can be controlled with the same topic.<br />
        This node only uses the <code>name</code> part. <code>#</code> and <code>number</code> are optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        This node controls roller shutters or blinds.
        There are 3 outputs that can be controlled:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Up:</b> <code>msg.payload = true;</code> starts the roller shutter to move up and <code>msg.payload = false;</code> stops it again. </li>
            <li><b>Down:</b> <code>msg.payload = true;</code> starts the roller shutter to move down and <code>msg.payload = false;</code> stops it again. </li>
            <li><b>Status Position:</b> <code>msg.payload = 42;</code>Shows the current status of the roller shutter. 0 = open, 100 = closed.</li>
        </ol>
        The outputs are assigned to the respective KNX group addresses.
    </p>

    <p>
        This node manages the running time for the roller shutter itself.
        It is also possible to have the roller shutter switch off automatically after a defined time.
        Example: <code>msg = { "topic": "up", "time_on": 5000 }</code> or <code>msg = { "topic": "up", "time_on": "5s" }</code><br />
        This message causes the roller shutter to move up for 5000 milliseconds / 5 seconds. If it is a blind, the slats are rotated accordingly.
        The following values can be used as a unit for time:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Unit</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>ms</code> (default)</td>
                    <td>Milliseconds</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>s</code> or <code>sec</code></td>
                    <td>Seconds</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>m</code> or <code>min</code></td>
                    <td>Minutes.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>h</code></td>
                    <td>Hours</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        To correct possible position deviations, the roller shutter always runs for at least 5 seconds if nothing else has been set in <code>msg.on_time</code>.
        This means that the roller shutter can be raised even further if it is recognized as open in the system, but in reality it is not yet completely up.<br>
        Sometimes it may also be desirable for a roller shutter not to start again at 0 or 100%. For this, <code>msg.exact = true</code> must be set.

        Specifying a time does not work with the topic <b>position</b>.
