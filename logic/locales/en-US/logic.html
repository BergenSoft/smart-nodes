<script type="text/html" data-help-name="smart_logic">
    <p>This node offers various logic operations, such as AND, OR and XOR.</p>
    <p>All inputs and the output can be specifically inverted, which can be used to map further complex logic.</p>
    <p>For example, to create a NOT logic, the number of inputs is set to 1, the logic to AND or OR and the output is inverted.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Smart Nodes use topics in the format <code>name#number</code>, so that different Smart Nodes can be controlled with the same topic.<br />
        This node only uses the <code>number</code> part. <code>name</code> and <code>#</code> are optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> <code>msg.payload</code> is automatically set to the logic result if it has not already been set in the configuration.
