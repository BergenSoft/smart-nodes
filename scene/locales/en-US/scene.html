    <p>
        This node controls several outputs that are switched on or off based on a defined scene.

        <code>msg.payload = true</code> or <code>msg.payload = false</code> is always sent to each output to switch it on or off.

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Smart nodes use topics in the format <code>name#number</code>, so different smart nodes can be controlled with the same topic.<br />
        This node uses both the <code>name</code> and <code>number</code> parts. Depending on the message, both values may need to be set.

                        When an output changes, the time measurement is started for the stored or sent time, if available.

                        If only one scene is specified, the block switches between the specified scene and off.<br />
                        If at least one output is switched on, the time measurement starts again.

    <p>
        This node has an adjustable maximum runtime before all outputs are automatically switched off again.
        This time measurement is used as in the table above.
        The set time can be overwritten specifically.
        Example: <code>msg = { "topic": "on", "time_on": 5000 }</code> or <code>msg = { "topic": "on", "time_on": "5s" }</code><br />
        This message switches the light on for 5000 milliseconds / 5 seconds and then off again.
        The next message without <code>time_on</code> specification uses the preset time again.
        If the time is set to 0, the light will <b>not</b> be switched off automatically.<br />
        The following values can be used as the unit for the time:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Unit</th>

            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>ms</code> (default)</td>
                    <td>Milliseconds</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>s</code> or <code>sec</code></td>
                    <td>Seconds</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>m</code> or <code>min</code></td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
